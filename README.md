# 🏠 Zillow Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Zillow’s home values (Zestimates) using property datasets that include tax assessments, transaction records, and property attributes. The goal is to minimize the error between actual sale prices and predicted values using advanced machine learning models.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Data preprocessing: cleaned, merged, and handled missing values in property datasets.  
- Feature engineering: created property age, location-based averages, and square-footage ratios.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): correlation analysis, geospatial mapping, and visualization of price trends.  
- Model building: implemented and compared **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**.  
- Model tuning: optimized hyperparameters with cross-validation for improved accuracy.  
- Evaluation: measured performance using **RMSE & MAE**, achieving reduced prediction error over baseline.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Techniques:** Regression Modeling, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Cross-Validation  

## 📊 Results
- Significantly reduced prediction error compared to baseline Zestimate.  
- Identified key property attributes influencing home value.  
- Delivered insights useful for **real estate price forecasting**.
